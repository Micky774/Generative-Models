Experiment Log
==============

Running 3DConv with lsdim 16, and psuedos 25 at batch size 64,128,256 with all else being equal for 40 epochs

b(1,2,3) corresponds to batch size (64,128,256) respectively

weights of form b(x).h5 have run for 30 epochs

weights of form b(x)e(n) have run for 30*n epochs

trial 4: python 3DConv.py --epochs 100 --lr 1e-5 --batch-size 32 --pseudos 25 --lsdim 256

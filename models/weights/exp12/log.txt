Experiment Log
==============

Corresponding to tb runs/obs5, experimenting with pseudoinput learning rates as which are the cartesian product of
pl([1,4,7]x[e-5,e-6,e-7]) corresponding to designation [1,4,7]x[e5,e6,e7]. Experiment is run for 30 epochs at lsdim 16, pseudos 25, 
batch-size 50, global lr 1e-3

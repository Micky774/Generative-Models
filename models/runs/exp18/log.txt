exp18 Experiment Log:
=======================================================================================
Date: 11/8/2019
Model Architecture: VtPVAE
Non-default arguments: cartesian product of epochs and batch normalization ({30,60,90} x {default, --batchNorm, --batchNorm --batch-tracking})
Weights for models without batch normalization stored as unnormedxx.h5 where xx is the number of epochs
Weights for models with batch normalization without tracking running statistics stored as notrackingxx.h5 where xx is the number of epochs
Weights for models with batch normalization and tracking running statistics stored as runningxx.h5 where xx is the number of epochs
